Link to site: https://jcqlng.github.io/Crystal-Collector/
In this assignment I have re-created a game called "crystal collector". In the game are the following instructions given by the code boot-camp -
The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters.

# App functions:

   * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * The app hides this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     * When they do click one, the app updates the player's score counter.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

     * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
   
# Bug Fixes and Updates

* In the first deployment there was an issue where the first click automatically is a win.
